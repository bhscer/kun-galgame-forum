// Flat-tier mutation helpers for the galgame comment tree.
//
// The visual model is intentionally TWO TIERS only: root + a flat list
// of replies. The DB still tracks the full parent_comment_id chain
// (so true "回复给某条" semantics survive via targetUser), but the
// frontend always renders root.replies as a single flat group with no
// further indent. These helpers therefore treat root.replies as a
// flat array — never walk inside a reply looking for sub-replies.
//
// Both Container.vue (inline list, ≤3 replies per root) and
// ThreadDrawer.vue (full thread, unbounded) call into the same logic.
// All returns are immutable: the input root is not mutated, and a new
// root object is returned so Vue can detect the change even when
// stored behind a shallowRef.

// Prepend `newReply` at the TOP of root.replies and bump replyCount.

// at the top of the list. Always returns a fresh root object.

// descendants that happen to be loaded in the flat list. The DB
// cascades the actual rows via parent_comment_id FK; this mirrors that
// on the client so the visible list doesn't dangle.
//
// `removedSize` is the subtree size reported by the caller (the
// deleted node + all its DB descendants — most of which may not even
// be loaded). We decrement replyCount by that exact amount because
// the count is authoritative for the WHOLE thread, not just what's
// visible.
// Patch a single comment node in the tree (root or one of its
// flat-attached replies). Returns a fresh root with the matching
// node replaced; the rest of the tree is untouched. Used for the
